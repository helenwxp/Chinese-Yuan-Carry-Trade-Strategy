# Chinese-Yuan-Carry-Trade-Strategy

My graduation thesis for Bachelor's Degree focused on a popular speculation activity in forex market -- currency carry trade. Although scholars have already paid much attention to global currency carry trade from the perspective of a US-based speculator, the performance of emerging market currencies are rarely discussed. Thus my thesis studied Chinese Yuan carry trade and this repository is to store the main codes employed in my paper.

*Initially I was thinking about presenting my codes on GitHub. However, later on, due to Copyright concern, I prefer setting my codes as private (only designated collaborator can view my codes). So if you are really interested, please send an email to my personal account: helenwxp@foxmail.com. I will email the following codes to you:*

**Fml Portfolio Construction.ipynb**  
Python codes for cleansing data and constructing the trade strategy.

**usdcarr_modelling.R**  
R codes for LSTR modelling of USD/CNY single currency pair carry trade.

**ggplot2practice.R**  
R codes for visualizing the movement of relevant economic variables.
